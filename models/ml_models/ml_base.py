class ml_model:
    """
    Base class for machine learning models.

    This class serves as a foundation for all machine learning models that will be
    developed. It provides a structure for initialization and can be extended to
    include common methods and attributes for machine learning tasks.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    None

    Methods:
    -------
    __init__()
        Initializes the ml_model instance. Subclasses should implement their own
        initialization logic to set up model parameters and configurations.

    Notes:
    -----
    This class is intended to be subclassed, and not used directly. Subclasses should
    implement the train, validate, and predict methods to provide full functionality.
